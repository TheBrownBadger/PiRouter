# Setup/configuration of NAT rules

# Enable NAT and Routing

`sudo vim /etc/sysctl.conf`


# Uncomment or add:
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# Next, Flush Old iptables Rules
`sudo iptables -F`
`sudo iptables -t nat -F`


# Next, add NAT rule (wlan1 is our uplink, wlan0 is our access point)
`sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE`
`sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan0 -o wlan1 -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT`
`sudo iptables -A FORWARD -i wlan1 -o wlan0 -j ACCEPT`


# Save iptables
`sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"`

# Start Acess Point
`sudo systemctl start hosapd`

## At this point you should test the connect from a client
## Be sure you can
  - Check IP (should be in the range you've specified)
  - Ping uplink
  - Ping 8.8.8.8
  - Ping google.com

# If any of these fail, check the troubleshooting guide.
